# Integration with JupiterOne

## {{provider}} + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

TODO: Iterate the benefits of ingesting data from the provider into JupiterOne.
Consider the following examples:

- Visualize {{provider}} services, teams, and users in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map {{provider}} users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to {{provider}} users using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

TODO: Iterate significant activities the integration enables. Consider the
following examples:

- JupiterOne periodically fetches services, teams, and users from {{provider}}
  to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

TODO: Iterate requirements for setting up the integration. Consider the
following examples:

- {{provider}} supports the OAuth2 Client Credential flow. You must have a
  Administrator user account.
- JupiterOne requires a REST API key. You need permission to create a user in
  {{provider}} that will be used to obtain the API key.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

   the integration instance.
